# Python-Arcade-Shooter
This is my first Python project. Its an arcade style shooter built using Pygame. It's still a work in progress as I have alot more ideas I want to implement. For now its a very simple yet functional game. I'll continue updating this README file with information on any changes I will make to this game. Thank you for your time and any feedback is appreciated!
